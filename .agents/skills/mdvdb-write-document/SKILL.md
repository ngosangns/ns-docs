  Create a new markdown (.md) document optimized for mdvdb indexing. Generates
  proper YAML frontmatter based on the vault's schema (including typed relation
  and File inputs while respecting read-only computed fields), structured
  headings for chunking, and wiki/markdown links to related files for graph
  connectivity. Use when creating new documents in an mdvdb vault, including
  documents with media, file attachments, or schemas containing Lookup or
  Rollup outputs.

# Write Document

Create a new markdown file optimized for mdvdb search, filtering, and graph connectivity.

**Input:** `$ARGUMENTS` is the topic, title, or description of the document to create.
Optionally include a target path (e.g., `docs/guides/setup.md`).

## Steps

### 1. Understand the vault's schema

Run the schema command to learn what frontmatter fields exist across the vault:
```
mdvdb schema --json
```

This reveals the metadata fields across the vault: their types, how many files
use each field, sample values, and any allowed value constraints. Different
folders may have different schemas (e.g., `/blog/` has date/author/tags,
`/people/` has role/team/email).

If a target folder is known, prefer the folder's table definition:
```
mdvdb collection <parent-dir> --json
```
Its `columns[]` (`name`, `field_type`, `required`, `in_schema`,
`relation_target`, `relation_field`, `target_field`, `relation_direction`,
`relation_scope`, `formula`, `result_type`, `sample_values`) describe the
folder's table. Relation columns use `relation_target` for their target folder;
Lookup/Rollup columns describe their computed traversal instead. Include
required ordinary inputs, but never seed a `Formula`, `Lookup`, or `Rollup`
output from `sample_values`: those properties are read-only and module-owned.
(`mdvdb schema --path <parent-dir> --json` gives the folder-scoped schema
directly.)

Also check what files are nearby:
```
mdvdb tree --path <parent-dir> --json
```

### 2. Find related content for linking

Search the vault for content related to the new document's topic:
```
mdvdb search "<topic>" --json --limit 10 --mode hybrid
```

These results will become link candidates — connecting the new document into the
vault's knowledge graph.

### 3. Write the document

Create the `.md` file with these components:

**YAML Frontmatter** (between `---` markers, at the very top):
- Include fields that match the vault's schema for this directory
- Use consistent types: strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, ISO dates
- Date format: `YYYY-MM-DD` or `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS`
- Tags as YAML arrays, not comma-separated strings
- Omit fields that don't apply (don't use `null`)
- These fields become search filters: `mdvdb search --filter status=published`
- **Relation fields**: a value that is entirely a link becomes a typed relation
  only when it targets another Markdown document. Write plain `.md` paths by
  default because they are easiest to read and write. Lists give multi-value
  relations. Wiki links and Markdown links remain supported; quote wiki links
  because unquoted `[[x]]` parses as a nested YAML array, not a relation.
  Relations are filterable (`--filter client=clients/acme`) and resolvable
  (`--populate`), and they join the link graph. See the manage-relations skill.
- **File fields** (mdvdb ≥ 0.2.0): use for collection-local non-Markdown
  attachments such as images, PDFs, audio, video, office files, or archives.
  Store root-relative wiki links in a YAML list even for zero or one value.
  Links with explicit non-Markdown extensions infer as `File`; pin ambiguous
  or extensionless names with `field_type: file` in the schema overlay. File
  values stay raw and do not join relations, backlinks, or the graph.
- **Formula, Lookup, and Rollup fields**: omit these output keys from authored
  YAML even when sibling files contain materialized examples. Author only the
  ordinary fields and Relations they consume. Ingest/watch safely computes the
  outputs; never copy, guess, or manually repair them.

```yaml

```

**Headings** (structure for chunking):
- Each heading creates a new searchable chunk
- Use proper hierarchy: H1 > H2 > H3 (don't skip levels)
- Keep sections focused: ~300-500 tokens per section is ideal
- Heading text becomes searchable section metadata
- A preamble paragraph before the first heading becomes its own chunk

```markdown
# Main Title

Brief introduction paragraph (this becomes chunk #0).

## First Section

Focused content on one aspect...

### Subsection

Deeper detail...

## Second Section

Another focused topic...
```

**Links** (build the knowledge graph):
- Use wiki links for quick internal references: `[[other-document]]`
- Use markdown links for contextual references: `[setup guide](../guides/setup.md)`
- Link to related documents found in step 2
- Link bidirectionally when it makes sense (A links to B, B links to A)
- Section-specific links work: `[[document#Section Heading]]`
- External URLs (https://) are ignored by the graph — only internal .md links matter
- Every link strengthens the graph and improves search via `--boost-links`

```markdown
Related to [[project-alpha]] and the [[architecture]] overview.
See [detailed implementation](./implementation.md#core-logic) for code.
```

**Content best practices:**
- Standard markdown: bold, italic, lists, code blocks, tables, blockquotes
- Mermaid diagrams supported in fenced code blocks
- Math expressions: `$inline$` and `$$block$$`
- Task lists: `- [x] done` / `- [ ] todo`
- Callouts: `> [!note]`, `> [!important]`, `> [!warning]`

### 4. Verify the document

After writing, suggest the user run:
- `mdvdb ingest --file <path>` to index the new document
- Inspect the ingest `module_reports`: Formula runs before `lookup_rollup`.
  Diagnose failures with `mdvdb modules status lookup_rollup --json`; never
  type a replacement computed value into the document.
- `mdvdb get <path> --populate` to verify frontmatter parsed correctly and
  every relation resolves (`exists: true`). Treat `frontmatter` as the
  authoritative computed value and inspect `computed_field_errors` before
  presenting any computed property.
- `mdvdb schema --path <parent-dir> --json` to confirm attachment columns are
  `"File"`; verify their physical paths directly because `--populate` applies
  only to relations
- `mdvdb links <path>` to confirm links were extracted
