# Search and Summarize

Search the vault, read the best matches, and synthesize a comprehensive answer.
Only works with `.md` files indexed by mdvdb.

**Input:** `$ARGUMENTS` is the research question or topic.

## Steps

1. Search the vault with link boosting:

   ```
   mdvdb search "$ARGUMENTS" --json --limit 8 --mode hybrid --boost-links --populate
   ```

   If the user names a Shard, resolve its immutable ID with
   `mdvdb shards list --json` and add `--shard <ID>`. Do not replace it with a
   guessed path or combine it with `--path`.
   (`--populate` resolves frontmatter relations so the synthesis can name
   related entities — clients, authors, projects.)

2. Identify the top-scoring files (score > 0.5 or top 5, whichever is more).
   (Do this client-side rather than with `--min-score`, which would drop the
   top-5 fallback on low-scoring queries.)

3. Read each identified file in full using the Read tool. Use the `file.path`
   field from each search result as the path (relative to the vault root).

4. For each file, note:
   - Main points relevant to the query
   - Key data, definitions, or arguments
   - How it relates to the other files (including relation fields from
     `file.relations`, e.g. shared clients or projects)

5. Produce a structured synthesis:

   **Answer**: A direct, comprehensive answer to the research question,
   drawing on all sources read.

   **Key Points**: Bulleted list of the most important findings.

   **Sources**: For each claim, cite the source file and section.
   Format: `[filename.md#Section Heading]`

   **Contradictions or Gaps**: Note any conflicting information between
   sources, or aspects of the question not covered by the vault.

6. Only include information actually found in the vault files.
   Do not add external knowledge unless explicitly asked.
